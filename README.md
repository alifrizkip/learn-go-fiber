# Go Fiber Hands-on

Learn [Go Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) framework by creating simple todo api with jwt authentication.

Recently in Node.js, I'm using Express.js to develop Rest API and I'm very familiar with it. I wanna develop API in golang, so I'm looking for Golang Web Framework with Express.js style, and I found this amazing [framework](https://gofiber.io/).

Things I learned from creating this project:
- [x] Fiber Router
- [x] Fiber Router Group
- [x] Fiber Middleware
- [x] JWT Authentication in Golang
- [x] Fiber Request Validation
- [x] GORM with postgresql
- [x] GORM Auto Migration
